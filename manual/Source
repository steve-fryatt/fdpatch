<chapter title="Introduction" file="Introduction">

<cite>FilerDirPatch</cite> is a small patch to cause a new directory to be created if <menu>New directory</menu> is selected in a Filer window (instead of moving the pointer right to open the dialogue box).

As a long-time user of <cite>MS Windows</cite>, this had always seemed an omission and with the arrival of RISC OS 4 and the <key>alt</key>-click renaming in the window, I often found myself wishing that the option worked as expected.

Although the patch is trivial, having written it it seems daft to make others who would like the feature re-invent the wheel.

<chapter title="Installing and Using FilerDirPatch" file="Use">

<cite>FilerDirPatch</cite> requires RISC OS 3.1 or later.  It is 26/32 bit netural and should work on RISC OS 5; it will not be needed on Select.

To install <cite>FilerDirPatch</cite>, copy the <file>FDPatch</file> module to a suitable place and double-click on it to run.  If you want it to run on startup, the module should be placed in your boot sequence.  On a machine with the new boot structure installed, this can be done by copying it into the <file>Choices:Boot.Tasks</file> directory. On older machines, you will have to make your own arrangements (but you will probably have made your own boot system anyway).

To use it, just click <mouse>select</mouse> on the <menu>New directory</menu> menu item and a new directory will be created in the current filer window (the one the menu was opened over) with the name <file>Directory</file>.  This can then be renamed as required.
